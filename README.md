# Unit Converter (Python)

This is a simple console application written in Python that allows you to convert values between different units of measurement, such as length and weight. The application features a user-friendly menu system and supports conversion of units defined in a JSON file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Run the application by executing the `main.py` script with Python 3.
3. You can also download the JSON file exe from this link: [LINK](https://github.com/DLQuake/Unit-converter-python/releases/tag/Published)
## Usage

To use the application, simply run the `main.py` script in your terminal. You will be presented with a menu where you can select the type of unit you wish to convert and enter the value to be converted.

After selecting the units, the application will display the converted value along with the original and target units. The terminal will be cleared after the conversion is complete.

## Customization

The application supports custom units of measurement defined in a JSON file. To add or modify units, simply edit the `units.json`. The file uses a simple key-value structure to define conversion ratios between units.

## Requirements

The application requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries or dependencies are needed.
